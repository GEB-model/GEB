Hello! Welcome to GEB! You can find full documentation [here](https://geb-model.github.io/GEB/).

## Installation

The model can be installed with pip as follows:

`pip install geb`

## Overview
GEB (Geographic Environmental and Behavioural model) aims to simulate both the environment, the individual behaviour of people and their interactions at small and large scale. The model does so through a "deep" coupling of an agent-based model which simulates millions of individual people or households, a hydrological model, a vegetation model and a hydrodynamic model.

The figure below shows a schematic overview of the model agent-based and hydrological model.

## Building on the shoulders of giants

GEB builds on, couples and extends several models, depicted in the figure below.
