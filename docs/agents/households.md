## Flood damage model 

Currently, flood damage calculations are performed in the households script. When a flood is simulated using the SFINCS model, the damage is automatically calculated. We use exposure data from several sources. Buildings are taken from the OpenBuildingMap dataset. Roads and railways are taken from OpenStreetMap. Agriculture and forest areas are taken from the ESA WorldCover database. The exposure data is combined with vulnerability curves to calculate the damage per object. The vulnerability curve shows the relationship between inundation depth and the damage factor (i.e. the fraction of maximum damage for a certain water depth). For buildings, we use the curves derived by Endendijk et al.[@endendijk2023flood]. For roads, we use the curves derived by Van Ginkel et al.[@van2021flood]. For railways, we use the curves developed by Kellermann et al.[@kellermann2015estimating]. For nature and agriculture, we use the curves developed by De Moel et al.[@de2014evaluating]. The maximum damages for buildings are taken from the Global Exposure Model[@yepes2023global]. The Global Exposure Model is a mosaic of local and regional models with information regarding the residential, commercial, and industrial building stock at the smallest available administrative division of each country and includes details about the number of buildings, number of occupants, vulnerability characteristics, average built-up area, and average replacement cost. The figure below shows all curves and maximum damages used in the damage model. Damages are reported for every exposure category individually and as a combined total damage value.
