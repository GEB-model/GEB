Configuration
#####################

The model can be configured through using `GEB.yml` (YALM-format). In the model code, this configution file is parsed and can be accessed through `self.model.config`. Below the various sections of the configuration file are discussed. CWatM can be configured using its own configuration file `CWatM_GEB.ini`. To configure this file we refer to the `CWatM documentation <https://cwatm.iiasa.ac.at/>`_.
