Forecasts
#####################

GEB supports the integration of weather forecasts to enable short-range hydrological forecasting and forecast reponse modelling. This functionality supports ensemble forecasts, in which each ensemble is run through the model chain in "multiverse mode".

Overview
========

The forecast system in GEB enables:

* **Short-range hydrological forecasting**: Run hydrological simulations using weather forecast data
* **Ensemble forecasting**: Use multiple forecast members to quantify uncertainty
* **Trigger early warnings**: Provide flood warnings based on forecast data
* **Forecast-informed decision making**: Support agent decisions based on forecast scenarios

The system currently supports ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) operational forecasts, with plans to extend support to hindcast data.

Configuration
=============

Forecast configuration is specified in the ``build.yml`` file under the ``setup_forecasts`` method.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

**forecast_start** *(required)*
    Start date for forecast data downloads. Format: ``YYYY-MM-DD``
    
    Example: ``"2024-01-01"``

**forecast_end** *(required)*
    End date for forecast data downloads. Format: ``YYYY-MM-DD``
    
    Example: ``"2024-01-31"``

**forecast_provider** *(required)*
    The forecast data provider. Currently only ``"ECMWF"`` is supported.
    
    Options: ``"ECMWF"``

**forecast_model** *(required)*
    The type of ECMWF forecast model to use:
    
    * ``"probabilistic_forecast"``: Ensemble forecasts with 50 members (perturbed forecasts)
    * ``"control_forecast"``: Deterministic forecast (single member)
    
    Options: ``"probabilistic_forecast"`` | ``"control_forecast"``

**forecast_resolution** *(required)*
    Spatial resolution of the forecast data in degrees.

**forecast_horizon** *(required)*
    Maximum forecast lead time in hours. The forecast will extend this many hours from each initialization time.

**forecast_timestep_hours** *(required)*
    Temporal resolution of the forecast data in hours.
    
    Note: ECMWF has different temporal resolutions available depending on the forecast date:
    
    * Before 2016-11-23: 3-hourly from 0-144h, 6-hourly from 144-360h
    * From 2016-11-23 onwards: hourly from 0-90h, 3-hourly from 90-144h, 6-hourly from 144-360h

ECMWF Forecast Support
======================

Data Source
-----------

GEB downloads forecast data from the ECMWF MARS (Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System) archive using the ECMWF Web API. This provides access to:

* **Operational archive**: Real-time and historical operational forecasts from 2010 onwards
* **High-resolution forecasts**: Spatial resolutions from 0.25° to 1.0°
* **Ensemble forecasts**: 50-member ensemble for uncertainty quantification
* **Control forecasts**: Single deterministic forecast runs

Supported Variables
-------------------

GEB automatically downloads the following meteorological variables from ECMWF:

Forecast Types
--------------

**Ensemble Forecasts (probabilistic_forecast)**
    * **Members**: 50 perturbed forecast members
    * **Purpose**: Quantify forecast uncertainty and provide probabilistic information
    * **Use case**: Risk assessment, early warning systems, ensemble-based decision making
    * **Output**: Multiple possible scenarios for each forecast initialization
    * **File naming**: ``ENS_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.grb``

**Control Forecasts (control_forecast)**
    * **Members**: 1 deterministic forecast
    * **Purpose**: Single "best guess" forecast without uncertainty information
    * **Use case**: Deterministic forecasting, computational efficiency
    * **Output**: Single scenario for each forecast initialization
    * **File naming**: ``CTRL_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.grb``

Setup Requirements
==================

API Access
----------

To use ECMWF forecasts, you need:

1. **ECMWF API Key**: Register at https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/
2. **Environment Variable**: Set variables in your environment or ``.env`` file located in the GEB repository.
    Request access to the ECMWF MARS database <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+to+MARS+data>, and extend the ".env"-file in the GEB repository with the following content:

.. code-block:: text
    ECMWF_API_KEY=<your_API_KEY>
    ECMWF_API_URL="https://api.ecmwf.int/v1"
    ECMWF_API_EMAIL=<your_email>
3. **ECMWF Python API**: Install the ECMWF API client

Multiverse Mode
---------------

When forecasts are enabled in the model configuration (``model.yml``), GEB automatically enters "multiverse mode" when forecast data is available for the current simulation date:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # model.yml
    general:
      forecasts:
        use: true  # Enable forecast-based multiverse mode

During multiverse mode:

1. **State Saving**: Current model state is saved before forecast processing
2. **Member Processing**: Each forecast member is processed sequentially:
   
   * Original forcing data is replaced with forecast data
   * Model runs to the end of the forecast period
   * Results are calculated and stored
   
3. **State Restoration**: Model state is restored to the original condition
4. **Continuation**: Normal simulation continues with historical data
