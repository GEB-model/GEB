## Vegetation

### Crop group numbers

The model uses crop group numbers to characterize the drought sensitivity of vegetation types (Forest and Grassland-like). These parameters determine the fraction of easily available soil water ($p$).

The data is obtained from LISFLOOD[@vanderknijff2010lisflood] data repository. There derivation of the paramters is described [here](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/4_Static-Maps_land-use-depending/).

### Leaf Area Index

The model uses Leaf Area Index (LAI) to calculate the interception capacity of the canopy, specifically for forests. LAI is dimensionless and represents the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area ($m^2/m^2$).

The data is obtained from LISFLOOD[@vanderknijff2010lisflood] data repository. There derivation of the paramters is described [here](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/4_Static-Maps_leaf-area-index/).
