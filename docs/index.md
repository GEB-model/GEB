# GEB

Welcome to GEB's documentation! GEB stands for Geographic Environmental and Behavioural model and is named after Geb, the personification of Earth in Egyptian mythology.

GEB aims to simulate both environment, the individual behaviour of people and their interactions at small and large scale. The model does so through a "deep" coupling of an agent-based model which simulates millions individual people or households, a hydrological model, a vegetation model and a hydrodynamic model.

## Building on the shoulders of giants

GEB builds on, couples and extends several models, depicted in the figure below.
