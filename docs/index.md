# GEB

GEB (Geographical Environmental and Behavioural model) simulates the environment (e.g., hydrology, floods), the individual people, households and orginizations as well as their interactions at both small and large scale. The model does so through a "deep" coupling of an agent-based model a hydrological model, a vegetation model and a hydrodynamic model. You can find full documentation [here](https://docs.geb.sh/).

The figure below shows a schematic overview of GEB.

## Building on the shoulders of giants

GEB builds on, couples and extends several models, depicted in the figure below.
