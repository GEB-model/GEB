Create farm size map
#############################

This file :doc:`6_get_farm_sizes` file automatically downloads farm sizes from the Indian agricultural census database. This is only needed when you will create farms yourself, rather than reading them from a high-resolution dataset. The farm sizes from the agricultural census are used to create a more statistically representative farm dataset.
