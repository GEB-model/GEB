GEB uses HydroMT to preprocess all data required for the model. HydroMT (Hydro Model Tools) is an open-source Python package that facilitates the process of building and analyzing spatial geoscientific models with a focus on water system models. It does so by automating the workflow to go from raw data to a complete model instance which is ready to run. This plugin provides an implementation of the model API for the GEB model.
