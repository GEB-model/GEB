  abstract = {Abstract Finding an explicit solution to the widely used Green–Ampt (G–A) one-dimensional infiltration model has been subject of efforts for more than half a century. We derived an explicit semiempirical approach that combines accuracy with simplicity, a concept that has been generally neglected in previous studies. The equation is \$F\; = {K\_s}\;t\;( {0.70635 + 0.32415\sqrt {1 + 9.43456( {\frac{{{S^2}}}{{{K\_s}^2t}}} )} } )\$, with F (L), Ks (L/T), S (L/T0.5) and t (T) being cumulative infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, sorptivity, and time, respectively. Relative errors (ɛ) by the application of this equation generally do not exceed ±0.3\% in most applied infiltration problems faced by water resources engineering today. We show both numerically and mathematically that │ɛ│> 0.3\% could only occur if Kst/F > 0.904, a criterion that could apply to sand and loamy sand soils (i.e., coarse texture) and if they experience infiltration rates for over 6 h and 19 h, respectively. Hence, we also derived a simple linear adjustment in the model as Fadj ≅ 0.9796 F + 0.335 S2/Ks to address these longer infiltration rates, and to assure that ɛ remains within the expected ±0.3\% range of uncertainty. A linearized regression technique was also developed to accurately estimate S and Ks when the G–A model is used. We numerically demonstrated that our fitting method could be used even when the G–A approach is less valid (diffusive soils), provided that the actual value of the capillary length (λ) is initially known. An added benefit of our approach is that by setting λ equal to 1/3 and 2/3, it can significantly limit the range of initializing, unknown, a priori values of S and Ks, as these two parameters are estimated through the inverse solution of implicit infiltration models. Due to the model's simplicity and accuracy, our solution should find application among hydrologists, natural resource scientists, and engineers who wish to easily derive accurate estimations from the G–A infiltration approach and/or estimate sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity without encountering divergence problems.},

  abstract = {The Xinanjiang model is a rainfall-runoff, distributed, basin model for use in humid and semi-humid regions. The evapotranspiration component is represented by a model of three soil layers. Runoff production occurs on repletion of storage to capacity values which are assumed to be distributed throughout the basin. Prior to 1980, runoff was separated into surface and groundwater components using Horton's concept of infiltration. Subsequently, the concept of hillslope hydrology was introduced with an additional component, interflow, being identified. Runoff concentration to the outflow of each sub-basin is represented by a unit hydrograph or by a lag and route technique. The damping or routing effects of the channel system connecting the sub-basins are represented by Muskingum routing. There are fifteen parameters in all, of which the model is particularly sensitive to six. Optimization of the parameters is achieved with different objective functions according to the nature of each parameter. The model has been widely used in China since 1980, mainly for flood forecasting, though more recently it is also being used for other purposes.}

  abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},
