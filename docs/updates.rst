v0.2
==================
This version focusses on improving improving the user experience, for example by

* Making the package installable as a package
* Making command line tools
* Vastly improving the preprocessing steps, now using hydroMT such that it is possible to quickly set up the model in any basin around the world (rather than using 14! preprocessing scripts)
