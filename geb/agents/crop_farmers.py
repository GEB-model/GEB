The abstraction order is channel irrigation, reservoir irrigation, groundwater irrigation.

        field_indices: This array contains the indices of all fields, ordered by farmer. In other words, if a farmer owns multiple fields, the indices of the fields are indices.
        irrigation_efficiency: Boolean array that specifies whether the specific farmer is efficient with water use.
        irrigated: Array that specifies whether a farm is irrigated.
        well_irrigated: Array that specifies whether a farm is groundwater irrigated.
        cell_area: The area of each subcell in m2.
        HRU_to_grid: Array to map the index of each subcell to the corresponding cell.
        crop_map: Map of the currently growing crops.
