    """Assign calculation groups to river segments based on their topological stream order and endpoints.

    We want to run every river rivers independently of the other river rivers. Here, we make
    two observations:

    1. If two river rivers have the same endpoint, they must performed in another run.
    2. If a river shares its endpoint with the startpoint of another river, they must be performed in another run.

    Thus, we first split rivers by their topological stream order. If more there is at least one stream
    order between two rivers, they can be performed in the same run. We can simplify this to running every
    even stream order in one run and every odd stream order in another run.

    Furthermore, when two (or in rare cases three) rivers share the same endpoint, we must also run them
    in different runs. Therefore, we group the rivers by their endpoint and assign them to a calculation group.

    The outcome is calculation groups 1-6, where 3 and 6 are only used when there are three rivers
    sharing the same endpoint.
