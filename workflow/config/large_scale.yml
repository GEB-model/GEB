# Large-scale multi-basin cluster configuration

# Directory containing the cluster models (created by init_multiple)
LARGE_SCALE_DIR: "/scistor/ivm/tbr910/GEB/models/large_scale"

# Prefix used when creating clusters (e.g., test_000, test_001, etc.)
CLUSTER_PREFIX: "WE"

# Evaluation methods to run for each cluster
EVALUATION_METHODS: "plot_discharge,evaluate_discharge"

# Automatic Memory Allocation:
# Memory and partition are now automatically determined based on basin size in model.yml
# Basin areas > 60,000 km² automatically use ivm-fat partition with up to 128GB RAM
# Basin areas < 60,000 km² use ivm partition with scaled memory allocation
# 
# Memory scaling factors:
# - Build: 32GB base (up to 128GB for very large basins)
# - Spinup: 48GB base (up to 192GB for very large basins) 
# - Run: 56GB base (up to 224GB for very large basins, capped at partition limits)

# Parallel execution settings
PARALLEL:
  # Maximum number of clusters to run simultaneously
  # Adjust based on your system's memory and CPU capacity
  max_concurrent_builds: 10
  max_concurrent_runs: 10
